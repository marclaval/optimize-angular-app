The context\n * for each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable\n * set to the current item from the iterable.\n *\n * ### Local Variables\n *\n * `NgForOf` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n *\n * - `$implicit: T`: The value of the individual items in the iterable (`ngForOf`).\n * - `ngForOf: NgIterable<T>`: The value of the iterable expression. Useful when the expression is\n * more complex then a property access, for example when using the async pipe (`userStreams |\n * async`).\n * - `index: number`: The index of the current item in the iterable.\n * - `first: boolean`: True when the item is the first item in the iterable.\n * - `last: boolean`: True when the item is the last item in the iterable.\n * - `even: boolean`: True when the item has an even index in the iterable.\n * - `odd: boolean`: True when the item has an odd index in the iterable.\n *\n * ```\n * <li *ngFor=\"let user of userObservable | async as users; indexes as i; first as isFirst\">\n *    {{i}}/{{users.length}}. {{user}} <span *ngIf=\"isFirst\">default</span>\n * </li>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Change Propagation\n *\n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgForOf` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n *\n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can\n * be animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state\n * such as user input.\n *\n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\n * be avoided if possible.\n *\n * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgForOf` supports `trackBy` option.\n * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.\n * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.\n *\n * ### Syntax\n *\n * - `<li *ngFor=\"let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n * - `<li template=\"ngFor let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n *\n * With `<ng-template>` element:\n *\n * ```\n * <ng-template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\" let-i=\"index\" [ngForTrackBy]=\"trackByFn\">\n *   <li>...</li>\n * </ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed\n * example.\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar NgForOf = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _viewContainer\n     * @param {?} _template\n     * @param {?} _differs\n     */\n    function NgForOf(_viewContainer, _template, _differs) {\n        this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n        this._template = _template;\n        this._differs = _differs;\n        this._differ = null;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(NgForOf.prototype, \"ngForTrackBy\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._trackByFn; },\n        /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (fn) {\n            if (__webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__angular_core__[\"P\" /* isDevMode */])() && fn != null && typeof fn !== 'function') {\n                // TODO(vicb): use a log service once there is a public one available\n                if ((console) && (console.warn)) {\n                    console.warn(\"trackBy must be a function, but received \" + JSON.stringify(fn) + \". \" +\n                        \"See https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/common/index/NgFor-directive.html#!#change-propagation for more information.\");\n                }\n            }\n            this._trackByFn = fn;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgForOf.prototype, \"ngForTemplate\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} value\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (value) {\n            // TODO(TS2.1): make TemplateRef<Partial<NgForRowOf<T>>> once we move to TS v2.1\n            // The current type is too restrictive; a template that just uses index, for example,\n            // should be acceptable.\n            if (value) {\n                this._template = value;\n            }\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgForOf.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        if ('ngForOf' in changes) {\n            // React on ngForOf changes only once all inputs have been initialized\n            var /** @type {?} */ value = changes['ngForOf'].currentValue;\n            if (!this._differ && value) {\n                try {\n                    this._differ = this._differs.find(value).create(this.ngForTrackBy);\n                }\n                catch (e) {\n                    throw new Error(\"Cannot find a differ supporting object '\" + value + \"' of type '\" + getTypeNameForDebugging(value) + \"'.

Because `then` and `else` are bindings, the template references can\n * change at runtime as shown in this example.\n *\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfThenElse'}\n *\n * # Storing conditional result in a variable\n *\n * A common pattern is that we need to show a set of properties from the same object. If the\n * object is undefined, then we have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to guard against\n * dereferencing a `null` value. This is especially the case when waiting on async data such as\n * when using the `async` pipe as shown in folowing example:\n *\n * ```\n * Hello {{ (userStream|async)?.last }}, {{ (userStream|async)?.first }}!\n * ```\n *\n * There are several inefficiencies in the above example:\n *  - We create multiple subscriptions on `userStream`. One for each `async` pipe, or two in the\n *    example above.\n *  - We cannot display an alternative screen while waiting for the data to arrive asynchronously.\n *  - We have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties, which is cumbersome.\n *  - We have to place the `async` pipe in parenthesis.\n *\n * A better way to do this is to use `ngIf` and store the result of the condition in a local\n * variable as shown in the the example below:\n *\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfAs'}\n *\n * Notice that:\n *  - We use only one `async` pipe and hence only one subscription gets created.\n *  - `ngIf` stores the result of the `userStream|async` in the local variable `user`.\n *  - The local `user` can then be bound repeatedly in a more efficient way.\n *  - No need to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties as `ngIf` will only\n *    display the data if `userStream` returns a value.\n *  - We can display an alternative template while waiting for the data.\n *\n * ### Syntax\n *\n * Simple form:\n * - `<div *ngIf=\"condition\">...</div>`\n * - `<div template=\"ngIf condition\">...</div>`\n * - `<ng-template [ngIf]=\"condition\"><div>...</div></ng-template>`\n *\n * Form with an else block:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition; else elseBlock\">...</div>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * Form with a `then` and `else` block:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition; then thenBlock else elseBlock\"></div>\n * <ng-template #thenBlock>...</ng-template>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * Form with storing the value locally:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition as value; else elseBlock\">{{value}}</div>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar NgIf = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _viewContainer\n     * @param {?} templateRef\n     */\n    function NgIf(_viewContainer, templateRef) {\n        this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n        this._context = new NgIfContext();\n        this._thenTemplateRef = null;\n        this._elseTemplateRef = null;\n        this._thenViewRef = null;\n        this._elseViewRef = null;\n        this._thenTemplateRef = templateRef;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(NgIf.prototype, \"ngIf\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} condition\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (condition) {\n            this._context.$implicit = this._context.ngIf = condition;\n            this._updateView();\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgIf.prototype, \"ngIfThen\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} templateRef\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (templateRef) {\n            this._thenTemplateRef = templateRef;\n            this._thenViewRef = null;

Consider the following route configuration:\n * `[{ path: 'user/:name', component: UserCmp }]`\n *\n * When linking to this `user/:name` route, you can write:\n * `<a routerLink='/user/bob'>link to user component</a>`\n *\n * \\@description\n *\n * The RouterLink directives let you link to specific parts of your app.\n *\n * When the link is static, you can use the directive as follows:\n * `<a routerLink=\"/user/bob\">link to user component</a>`\n *\n * If you use dynamic values to generate the link, you can pass an array of path\n * segments, followed by the params for each segment.\n *\n * For instance `['/team', teamId, 'user', userName, {details: true}]`\n * means that we want to generate a link to `/team/11/user/bob;details=true`.\n *\n * Multiple static segments can be merged into one\n * (e.g., `['/team/11/user', userName, {details: true}]`).\n *\n * The first segment name can be prepended with `/`, `./`, or `../`:\n * * If the first segment begins with `/`, the router will look up the route from the root of the\n *   app.\n * * If the first segment begins with `./`, or doesn't begin with a slash, the router will\n *   instead look in the children of the current activated route.\n * * And if the first segment begins with `../`, the router will go up one level.\n *\n * You can set query params and fragment as follows:\n *\n * ```\n * <a [routerLink]=\"['/user/bob']\" [queryParams]=\"{debug: true}\" fragment=\"education\">\n *   link to user component\n * </a>\n * ```\n * RouterLink will use these to generate this link: `/user/bob#education?debug=true`.\n *\n * (Deprecated in v4.0.0 use `queryParamsHandling` instead) You can also tell the\n * directive to preserve the current query params and fragment:\n *\n * ```\n * <a [routerLink]=\"['/user/bob']\" preserveQueryParams preserveFragment>\n *   link to user component\n * </a>\n * ```\n *\n * You can tell the directive to how to handle queryParams, available options are:\n *  - 'merge' merge the queryParams into the current queryParams\n *  - 'preserve' prserve the current queryParams\n *  - default / '' use the queryParams only\n *  same options for {\\@link NavigationExtras.queryParamsHandling}\n *\n * ```\n * <a [routerLink]=\"['/user/bob']\" [queryParams]=\"{debug: true}\" queryParamsHandling=\"merge\">\n *   link to user component\n * </a>\n * ```\n *\n * The router link directive always treats the provided input as a delta to the current url.\n *\n * For instance, if the current url is `/user/(box//aux:team)`.\n *\n * Then the following link `<a [routerLink]=\"['/user/jim']\">Jim</a>` will generate the link\n * `/user/(jim//aux:team)`.\n *\n * \\@ngModule RouterModule\n *\n * See {\\@link Router.createUrlTree} for more information.\n

\\@howToUse\n *\n * ```\n * <a routerLink=\"/user/bob\" routerLinkActive=\"active-link\">Bob</a>\n * ```\n *\n * \\@description\n *\n * The RouterLinkActive directive lets you add a CSS class to an element when the link's route\n * becomes active.\n *\n * Consider the following example:\n *\n * ```\n * <a routerLink=\"/user/bob\" routerLinkActive=\"active-link\">Bob</a>\n * ```\n *\n * When the url is either '/user' or '/user/bob', the active-link class will\n * be added to the `a` tag. If the url changes, the class will be removed.\n *\n * You can set more than one class, as follows:\n *\n * ```\n * <a routerLink=\"/user/bob\" routerLinkActive=\"class1 class2\">Bob</a>\n * <a routerLink=\"/user/bob\" [routerLinkActive]=\"['class1', 'class2']\">Bob</a>\n * ```\n *\n * You can configure RouterLinkActive by passing `exact: true`. This will add the classes\n * only when the url matches the link exactly.\n *\n * ```\n * <a routerLink=\"/user/bob\" routerLinkActive=\"active-link\" [routerLinkActiveOptions]=\"{exact:\n * true}\">Bob</a>\n * ```\n *\n * You can assign the RouterLinkActive instance to a template variable and directly check\n * the `isActive` status.\n * ```\n * <a routerLink=\"/user/bob\" routerLinkActive #rla=\"routerLinkActive\">\n *   Bob {{ rla.isActive ? '(already open)' : ''}}\n * </a>\n * ```\n *\n * Finally, you can apply the RouterLinkActive directive to an ancestor of a RouterLink.\n *\n * ```\n * <div routerLinkActive=\"active-link\" [routerLinkActiveOptions]=\"{exact: true}\">\n *   <a routerLink=\"/user/jim\">Jim</a>\n *   <a routerLink=\"/user/bob\">Bob</a>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * This will set the active-link class on the div tag if the url is either '/user/jim' or\n * '/user/bob'.\n *\n * \\@ngModule RouterModule\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar RouterLinkActive = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} router\n     * @param {?} element\n     * @param {?} renderer\n     * @param {?} cdr\n     */\n    function RouterLinkActive(router, element, renderer, cdr) {\n        var _this = this;\n        this.router = router;\n        this.element = element;\n        this.renderer = renderer;\n        this.cdr = cdr;\n        this.classes = [];\n        this.active = false;\n        this.routerLinkActiveOptions = { exact: false };\n        this.subscription = router.events.subscribe(function (s) {\n            if (s instanceof NavigationEnd) {\n                _this.update();\n            }\n        });\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(RouterLinkActive.prototype, \"isActive\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this.active;

The context\n * for each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable\n * set to the current item from the iterable.\n *\n * ### Local Variables\n *\n * `NgForOf` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n *\n * - `$implicit: T`: The value of the individual items in the iterable (`ngForOf`).\n * - `ngForOf: NgIterable<T>`: The value of the iterable expression. Useful when the expression is\n * more complex then a property access, for example when using the async pipe (`userStreams |\n * async`).\n * - `index: number`: The index of the current item in the iterable.\n * - `first: boolean`: True when the item is the first item in the iterable.\n * - `last: boolean`: True when the item is the last item in the iterable.\n * - `even: boolean`: True when the item has an even index in the iterable.\n * - `odd: boolean`: True when the item has an odd index in the iterable.\n *\n * ```\n * <li *ngFor=\"let user of userObservable | async as users; indexes as i; first as isFirst\">\n *    {{i}}/{{users.length}}. {{user}} <span *ngIf=\"isFirst\">default</span>\n * </li>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Change Propagation\n *\n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgForOf` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n *\n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can\n * be animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state\n * such as user input.\n *\n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\n * be avoided if possible.\n *\n * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgForOf` supports `trackBy` option.\n * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.\n * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.\n *\n * ### Syntax\n *\n * - `<li *ngFor=\"let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n * - `<li template=\"ngFor let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n *\n * With `<ng-template>` element:\n *\n * ```\n * <ng-template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\" let-i=\"index\" [ngForTrackBy]=\"trackByFn\">\n *   <li>...</li>\n * </ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed\n * example.\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar NgForOf = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _viewContainer\n     * @param {?} _template\n     * @param {?} _differs\n     */\n    function NgForOf(_viewContainer, _template, _differs) {\n        this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n        this._template = _template;\n        this._differs = _differs;\n        this._differ = null;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(NgForOf.prototype, \"ngForTrackBy\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._trackByFn; },\n        /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (fn) {\n            if (isDevMode() && fn != null && typeof fn !== 'function') {\n                // TODO(vicb): use a log service once there is a public one available\n                if ((console) && (console.warn)) {\n                    console.warn(\"trackBy must be a function, but received \" + JSON.stringify(fn) + \". \" +\n                        \"See https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/common/index/NgFor-directive.html#!#change-propagation for more information.\");\n                }\n            }\n            this._trackByFn = fn;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgForOf.prototype, \"ngForTemplate\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} value\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (value) {\n            // TODO(TS2.1): make TemplateRef<Partial<NgForRowOf<T>>> once we move to TS v2.1\n            // The current type is too restrictive; a template that just uses index, for example,\n            // should be acceptable.\n            if (value) {\n                this._template = value;\n            }\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgForOf.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        if ('ngForOf' in changes) {\n            // React on ngForOf changes only once all inputs have been initialized\n            var /** @type {?} */ value = changes['ngForOf'].currentValue;\n            if (!this._differ && value) {\n                try {\n                    this._differ = this._differs.find(value).create(this.ngForTrackBy);\n                }\n                catch (e) {\n                    throw new Error(\"Cannot find a differ supporting object '\" + value + \"' of type '\" + getTypeNameForDebugging(value) + \"'.

Typically the:\n *  - `then` template is the inline template of `ngIf` unless bound to a different value.\n *  - `else` template is blank unless it is bound.\n *\n * # Most common usage\n *\n * The most common usage of the `ngIf` directive is to conditionally show the inline template as\n * seen in this example:\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfSimple'}\n *\n * # Showing an alternative template using `else`\n *\n * If it is necessary to display a template when the `expression` is falsy use the `else` template\n * binding as shown. Note that the `else` binding points to a `<ng-template>` labeled `#elseBlock`.\n * The template can be defined anywhere in the component view but is typically placed right after\n * `ngIf` for readability.\n *\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfElse'}\n *\n * # Using non-inlined `then` template\n *\n * Usually the `then` template is the inlined template of the `ngIf`, but it can be changed using\n * a binding (just like `else`). Because `then` and `else` are bindings, the template references can\n * change at runtime as shown in this example.\n *\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfThenElse'}\n *\n * # Storing conditional result in a variable\n *\n * A common pattern is that we need to show a set of properties from the same object. If the\n * object is undefined, then we have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to guard against\n * dereferencing a `null` value. This is especially the case when waiting on async data such as\n * when using the `async` pipe as shown in folowing example:\n *\n * ```\n * Hello {{ (userStream|async)?.last }}, {{ (userStream|async)?.first }}!\n * ```\n *\n * There are several inefficiencies in the above example:\n *  - We create multiple subscriptions on `userStream`. One for each `async` pipe, or two in the\n *    example above.\n *  - We cannot display an alternative screen while waiting for the data to arrive asynchronously.\n *  - We have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties, which is cumbersome.\n *  - We have to place the `async` pipe in parenthesis.\n *\n * A better way to do this is to use `ngIf` and store the result of the condition in a local\n * variable as shown in the the example below:\n *\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfAs'}\n *\n * Notice that:\n *  - We use only one `async` pipe and hence only one subscription gets created.\n *  - `ngIf` stores the result of the `userStream|async` in the local variable `user`.\n *  - The local `user` can then be bound repeatedly in a more efficient way.\n *  - No need to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties as `ngIf` will only\n *    display the data if `userStream` returns a value.\n *  - We can display an alternative template while waiting for the data.\n *\n * ### Syntax\n *\n * Simple form:\n * - `<div *ngIf=\"condition\">...</div>`\n * - `<div template=\"ngIf condition\">...</div>`\n * - `<ng-template [ngIf]=\"condition\"><div>...</div></ng-template>`\n *\n * Form with an else block:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition;

Using the router, you can declaratively specify\n * application states, manage state transitions while taking care of the URL, and load bundles on\n * demand.\n *\n * [Read this developer guide](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/router.html) to get an\n * overview of how the router should be used.\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar RouterModule = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} guard\n     * @param {?} router\n     */\n    function RouterModule(guard, router) {\n    }\n    /**\n     * Creates a module with all the router providers and directives.
