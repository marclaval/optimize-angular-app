To register states to an animation trigger please have a look at the {\\@link trigger\n * trigger} function.\n *\n * #### The `void` state\n *\n * The `void` state value is a reserved word that angular uses to determine when the element is not\n * apart of the application anymore (e.g. when an `ngIf` evaluates to false then the state of the\n * associated element is void).\n *\n * #### The `*` (default) state\n *\n * The `*` state (when styled) is a fallback state that will be used if the state that is being\n * animated is not declared within the trigger.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * `state` will declare an animation state with its associated styles\n * within the given trigger.\n *\n * - `stateNameExpr` can be one or more state names separated by commas.\n * - `styles` refers to the {\\@link style styling data} that will be persisted on the element once\n * the state has been reached.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // \"void\" is a reserved name for a state and is used to represent\n * // the state in which an element is detached from from the application.\n * state(\"void\", style({ height: 0 }))\n *\n * // user-defined states\n * state(\"closed\", style({ height: 0 }))\n * state(\"open, visible\", style({ height: \"*\" }))\n * ```\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} name\n * @param {?} styles\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction state$1(name, styles) {\n    return { type: 0 /* State */, name: name, styles: styles };\n}\n/**\n * `keyframes` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\\@link\n * Component#animations-anchor component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of\n * how animations in Angular are used.\n *\n * `keyframes` specifies a collection of {\\@link style style} entries each optionally characterized\n * by an `offset` value.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * The `keyframes` animation function is designed to be used alongside the {\\@link animate animate}\n * animation function. Instead of applying animations from where they are currently to their\n * destination, keyframes can describe how each style entry is applied and at what point within the\n * animation arc (much like CSS Keyframe Animations do).\n *\n * For each `style()` entry an `offset` value can be set. Doing so allows to specifiy at what\n * percentage of the animate time the styles will be applied.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // the provided offset values describe when each backgroundColor value is applied.\n * animate(\"5s\", keyframes([\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"red\", offset: 0 }),\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"blue\", offset: 0.2 }),\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"orange\", offset: 0.3 }),\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"black\", offset: 1 })\n * ]))\n * ```\n *\n * Alternatively, if there are no `offset` values used within the style entries then the offsets\n * will be calculated automatically.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * animate(\"5s\", keyframes([\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"red\" }) // offset = 0\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"blue\" }) // offset = 0.33\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"orange\" }) // offset = 0.66\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"black\" }) // offset = 1\n * ]))\n * ```\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} steps\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction keyframes$1(steps) {\n    return { type: 5 /* KeyframeSequence */, steps: steps };\n}\n/**\n * `transition` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\\@link\n * Component#animations-anchor component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of\n * how animations in Angular are used.\n *\n * `transition` declares the {\\@link sequence sequence of animation steps} that will be run when the\n * provided `stateChangeExpr` value is satisfied. The `stateChangeExpr` consists of a `state1 =>\n * state2` which consists of two known states (use an asterix (`*`) to refer to a dynamic starting\n * and/or ending state).\n *\n * A function can also be provided as the `stateChangeExpr` argument for a transition and this\n * function will be executed each time a state change occurs. If the value returned within the\n * function is true then the associated animation will be run.\n *\n * Animation transitions are placed within an {\\@link trigger animation trigger}. For an transition\n * to animate to a state value and persist its styles then one or more {\\@link state animation\n * states} is expected to be defined.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * An animation transition is kicked off the `stateChangeExpr` predicate evaluates to true based on\n * what the previous state is and what the current state has become. In other words, if a transition\n * is defined that matches the old/current state criteria then the associated animation will be\n * triggered.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // all transition/state changes are defined within an animation trigger\n * trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *   // if a state is defined then its styles will be persisted when the\n *   // animation has fully completed itself\n *   state(\"on\", style({ background: \"green\" })),\n *   state(\"off\", style({ background: \"grey\" })),\n *\n *   // a transition animation that will be kicked off when the state value\n *   // bound to \"myAnimationTrigger\" changes from \"on\" to \"off\"\n *   transition(\"on => off\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // it is also possible to do run the same animation for both directions\n *   transition(\"on <=> off\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // or to define multiple states pairs separated by commas\n *   transition(\"on => off, off => void\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // this is a catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into\n *   // the page and the destination state is unknown\n *   transition(\"void => *\", [\n *     style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *     animate(500)\n *   ]),\n *\n *   // this will capture a state change between any states\n *   transition(\"* => *\", animate(\"1s 0s\")),\n *\n *   // you can also go full out and include a function\n *   transition((fromState, toState) => {\n *     // when `true` then it will allow the animation below to be invoked\n *     return fromState == \"off\" && toState == \"on\";\n *   }, animate(\"1s 0s\"))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation\n * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n * <div [\\@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n * ```\n *\n * #### The final `animate` call\n *\n * If the final step within the transition steps is a call to `animate()` that **only** uses a\n * timing value with **no style data** then it will be automatically used as the final animation arc\n * for the element to animate itself to the final state. This involves an automatic mix of\n * adding/removing CSS styles so that the element will be in the exact state it should be for the\n * applied state to be presented correctly.\n *\n * ```\n * // start off by hiding the element, but make sure that it animates properly to whatever state\n * // is currently active for \"myAnimationTrigger\"\n * transition(\"void => *\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500)\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Transition Aliases (`:enter` and `:leave`)\n *\n * Given that enter (insertion) and leave (removal) animations are so common, the `transition`\n * function accepts both `:enter` and `:leave` values which are aliases for the `void => *` and `*\n * => void` state changes.\n *\n * ```\n * transition(\":enter\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n * ])\n * transition(\":leave\", [\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} stateChangeExpr\n * @param {?} steps\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction transition$1(stateChangeExpr, steps) {\n    return { type: 1 /* Transition */, expr: stateChangeExpr, animation: steps };\n}\n/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google Inc.

The context\n * for each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable\n * set to the current item from the iterable.\n *\n * ### Local Variables\n *\n * `NgForOf` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n *\n * - `$implicit: T`: The value of the individual items in the iterable (`ngForOf`).\n * - `ngForOf: NgIterable<T>`: The value of the iterable expression. Useful when the expression is\n * more complex then a property access, for example when using the async pipe (`userStreams |\n * async`).\n * - `index: number`: The index of the current item in the iterable.\n * - `first: boolean`: True when the item is the first item in the iterable.\n * - `last: boolean`: True when the item is the last item in the iterable.\n * - `even: boolean`: True when the item has an even index in the iterable.\n * - `odd: boolean`: True when the item has an odd index in the iterable.\n *\n * ```\n * <li *ngFor=\"let user of userObservable | async as users; index as i; first as isFirst\">\n *    {{i}}/{{users.length}}. {{user}} <span *ngIf=\"isFirst\">default</span>\n * </li>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Change Propagation\n *\n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgForOf` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n *\n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can\n * be animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state\n * such as user input.\n *\n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\n * be avoided if possible.\n *\n * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgForOf` supports `trackBy` option.\n * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.\n * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.\n *\n * ### Syntax\n *\n * - `<li *ngFor=\"let item of items; index as i; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n * - `<li template=\"ngFor let item of items; index as i; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n *\n * With `<ng-template>` element:\n *\n * ```\n * <ng-template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\" let-i=\"index\" [ngForTrackBy]=\"trackByFn\">\n *   <li>...</li>\n * </ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed\n * example.\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar NgForOf = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _viewContainer\n     * @param {?} _template\n     * @param {?} _differs\n     */\n    function NgForOf(_viewContainer, _template, _differs) {\n        this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n        this._template = _template;\n        this._differs = _differs;\n        this._differ = null;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(NgForOf.prototype, \"ngForTrackBy\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._trackByFn; },\n        /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (fn) {\n            if (__webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__angular_core__[\"N\" /* isDevMode */])() && fn != null && typeof fn !== 'function') {\n                // TODO(vicb): use a log service once there is a public one available\n                if ((console) && (console.warn)) {\n                    console.warn(\"trackBy must be a function, but received \" + JSON.stringify(fn) + \". \" +\n                        \"See https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/common/index/NgFor-directive.html#!#change-propagation for more information.\");\n                }\n            }\n            this._trackByFn = fn;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgForOf.prototype, \"ngForTemplate\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} value\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (value) {\n            // TODO(TS2.1): make TemplateRef<Partial<NgForRowOf<T>>> once we move to TS v2.1\n            // The current type is too restrictive; a template that just uses index, for example,\n            // should be acceptable.\n            if (value) {\n                this._template = value;\n            }\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgForOf.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        if ('ngForOf' in changes) {\n            // React on ngForOf changes only once all inputs have been initialized\n            var /** @type {?} */ value = changes['ngForOf'].currentValue;\n            if (!this._differ && value) {\n                try {\n                    this._differ = this._differs.find(value).create(this.ngForTrackBy);\n                }\n                catch (e) {\n                    throw new Error(\"Cannot find a differ supporting object '\" + value + \"' of type '\" + getTypeNameForDebugging(value) + \"'.

Typically the:\n *  - `then` template is the inline template of `ngIf` unless bound to a different value.\n *  - `else` template is blank unless it is bound.\n *\n * # Most common usage\n *\n * The most common usage of the `ngIf` directive is to conditionally show the inline template as\n * seen in this example:\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfSimple'}\n *\n * # Showing an alternative template using `else`\n *\n * If it is necessary to display a template when the `expression` is falsy use the `else` template\n * binding as shown. Note that the `else` binding points to a `<ng-template>` labeled `#elseBlock`.\n * The template can be defined anywhere in the component view but is typically placed right after\n * `ngIf` for readability.\n *\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfElse'}\n *\n * # Using non-inlined `then` template\n *\n * Usually the `then` template is the inlined template of the `ngIf`, but it can be changed using\n * a binding (just like `else`). Because `then` and `else` are bindings, the template references can\n * change at runtime as shown in this example.\n *\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfThenElse'}\n *\n * # Storing conditional result in a variable\n *\n * A common pattern is that we need to show a set of properties from the same object. If the\n * object is undefined, then we have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to guard against\n * dereferencing a `null` value. This is especially the case when waiting on async data such as\n * when using the `async` pipe as shown in folowing example:\n *\n * ```\n * Hello {{ (userStream|async)?.last }}, {{ (userStream|async)?.first }}!\n * ```\n *\n * There are several inefficiencies in the above example:\n *  - We create multiple subscriptions on `userStream`. One for each `async` pipe, or two in the\n *    example above.\n *  - We cannot display an alternative screen while waiting for the data to arrive asynchronously.\n *  - We have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties, which is cumbersome.\n *  - We have to place the `async` pipe in parenthesis.\n *\n * A better way to do this is to use `ngIf` and store the result of the condition in a local\n * variable as shown in the the example below:\n *\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfAs'}\n *\n * Notice that:\n *  - We use only one `async` pipe and hence only one subscription gets created.\n *  - `ngIf` stores the result of the `userStream|async` in the local variable `user`.\n *  - The local `user` can then be bound repeatedly in a more efficient way.\n *  - No need to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties as `ngIf` will only\n *    display the data if `userStream` returns a value.\n *  - We can display an alternative template while waiting for the data.\n *\n * ### Syntax\n *\n * Simple form:\n * - `<div *ngIf=\"condition\">...</div>`\n * - `<div template=\"ngIf condition\">...</div>`\n * - `<ng-template [ngIf]=\"condition\"><div>...</div></ng-template>`\n *\n * Form with an else block:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition; else elseBlock\">...</div>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * Form with a `then` and `else` block:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition; then thenBlock else elseBlock\"></div>\n * <ng-template #thenBlock>...</ng-template>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * Form with storing the value locally:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition as value;

If the url changes, the class will be removed.\n *\n * You can set more than one class, as follows:\n *\n * ```\n * <a routerLink=\"/user/bob\" routerLinkActive=\"class1 class2\">Bob</a>\n * <a routerLink=\"/user/bob\" [routerLinkActive]=\"['class1', 'class2']\">Bob</a>\n * ```\n *\n * You can configure RouterLinkActive by passing `exact: true`. This will add the classes\n * only when the url matches the link exactly.\n *\n * ```\n * <a routerLink=\"/user/bob\" routerLinkActive=\"active-link\" [routerLinkActiveOptions]=\"{exact:\n * true}\">Bob</a>\n * ```\n *\n * You can assign the RouterLinkActive instance to a template variable and directly check\n * the `isActive` status.\n * ```\n * <a routerLink=\"/user/bob\" routerLinkActive #rla=\"routerLinkActive\">\n *   Bob {{ rla.isActive ? '(already open)' : ''}}\n * </a>\n * ```\n *\n * Finally, you can apply the RouterLinkActive directive to an ancestor of a RouterLink.\n *\n * ```\n * <div routerLinkActive=\"active-link\" [routerLinkActiveOptions]=\"{exact: true}\">\n *   <a routerLink=\"/user/jim\">Jim</a>\n *   <a routerLink=\"/user/bob\">Bob</a>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * This will set the active-link class on the div tag if the url is either '/user/jim' or\n * '/user/bob'.\n *\n * \\@ngModule RouterModule\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar RouterLinkActive = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} router\n     * @param {?} element\n     * @param {?} renderer\n     * @param {?} cdr\n     */\n    function RouterLinkActive(router, element, renderer, cdr) {\n        var _this = this;\n        this.router = router;\n        this.element = element;\n        this.renderer = renderer;\n        this.cdr = cdr;\n        this.classes = [];\n        this.active = false;\n        this.routerLinkActiveOptions = { exact: false };\n        this.subscription = router.events.subscribe(function (s) {\n            if (s instanceof NavigationEnd) {\n                _this.update();\n            }\n        });\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(RouterLinkActive.prototype, \"isActive\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this.active; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    RouterLinkActive.prototype.ngAfterContentInit = function () {\n        var _this = this;\n        this.links.changes.subscribe(function (_) { return _this.update(); });\n        this.linksWithHrefs.changes.subscribe(function (_) { return _this.update(); });\n        this.update();\n    };\n    Object.defineProperty(RouterLinkActive.prototype, \"routerLinkActive\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} data\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (data) {\n            var /** @type {?} */ classes = Array.isArray(data) ? data : data.split(' ');\n            this.classes = classes.filter(function (c) { return !!c; });\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    RouterLinkActive.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) { this.update(); };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    RouterLinkActive.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () { this.subscription.unsubscribe(); };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    RouterLinkActive.prototype.update = function () {\n        var _this = this;\n        if (!this.links || !this.linksWithHrefs || !this.router.navigated)\n            return;\n        var /** @type {?} */ hasActiveLinks = this.hasActiveLinks();\n        // react only when status has changed to prevent unnecessary dom updates\n        if (this.active !== hasActiveLinks) {\n            this.classes.forEach(function (c) { return _this.renderer.setElementClass(_this.element.nativeElement, c, hasActiveLinks); });\n            Promise.resolve(hasActiveLinks).then(function (active) { return _this.active = active; });\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} router\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    RouterLinkActive.prototype.isLinkActive = function (router) {\n        var _this = this;\n        return function (link) { return router.isActive(link.urlTree, _this.routerLinkActiveOptions.exact); };\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    RouterLinkActive.prototype.hasActiveLinks = function () {\n        return this.links.some(this.isLinkActive(this.router)) ||\n            this.linksWithHrefs.some(this.isLinkActive(this.router));\n    };\n    return RouterLinkActive;\n}());\nRouterLinkActive.decorators = [\n    { type: __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__angular_core__[\"X\" /* Directive */], args: [{\n                selector: '[routerLinkActive]',\n                exportAs: 'routerLinkActive',\n            },] },\n];\n/**\n * @nocollapse\n */\nRouterLinkActive.ctorParameters = function () { return [\n    { type: Router, },\n    { type: __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__angular_core__[\"Y\" /* ElementRef */], },\n    { type: __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__angular_core__[\"Z\" /* Renderer */], },\n    { type: __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__angular_core__[\"_11\" /* ChangeDetectorRef */], },\n]; };\nRouterLinkActive.propDecorators = {\n    'links': [{ type: __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__angular_core__[\"_30\" /* ContentChildren */], args: [RouterLink, { descendants: true },] },],\n    'linksWithHrefs': [{ type: __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__angular_core__[\"_30\" /* ContentChildren */], args: [RouterLinkWithHref, { descendants: true },] },],\n    'routerLinkActiveOptions': [{ type: __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__angular_core__[\"_0\" /* Input */] },],\n    'routerLinkActive': [{ type: __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__angular_core__[\"_0\" /* Input */] },],\n};\n/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google Inc.

For an transition\n * to animate to a state value and persist its styles then one or more {\\@link state animation\n * states} is expected to be defined.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * An animation transition is kicked off the `stateChangeExpr` predicate evaluates to true based on\n * what the previous state is and what the current state has become.

The context\n * for each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable\n * set to the current item from the iterable.\n *\n * ### Local Variables\n *\n * `NgForOf` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n *\n * - `$implicit: T`: The value of the individual items in the iterable (`ngForOf`).\n * - `ngForOf: NgIterable<T>`: The value of the iterable expression. Useful when the expression is\n * more complex then a property access, for example when using the async pipe (`userStreams |\n * async`).\n * - `index: number`: The index of the current item in the iterable.\n * - `first: boolean`: True when the item is the first item in the iterable.\n * - `last: boolean`: True when the item is the last item in the iterable.\n * - `even: boolean`: True when the item has an even index in the iterable.\n * - `odd: boolean`: True when the item has an odd index in the iterable.\n *\n * ```\n * <li *ngFor=\"let user of userObservable | async as users; index as i; first as isFirst\">\n *    {{i}}/{{users.length}}. {{user}} <span *ngIf=\"isFirst\">default</span>\n * </li>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Change Propagation\n *\n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgForOf` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n *\n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can\n * be animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state\n * such as user input.\n *\n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run.

Typically the:\n *  - `then` template is the inline template of `ngIf` unless bound to a different value.\n *  - `else` template is blank unless it is bound.\n *\n * # Most common usage\n *\n * The most common usage of the `ngIf` directive is to conditionally show the inline template as\n * seen in this example:\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfSimple'}\n *\n * # Showing an alternative template using `else`\n *\n * If it is necessary to display a template when the `expression` is falsy use the `else` template\n * binding as shown. Note that the `else` binding points to a `<ng-template>` labeled `#elseBlock`.\n * The template can be defined anywhere in the component view but is typically placed right after\n * `ngIf` for readability.\n *\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfElse'}\n *\n * # Using non-inlined `then` template\n *\n * Usually the `then` template is the inlined template of the `ngIf`, but it can be changed using\n * a binding (just like `else`). Because `then` and `else` are bindings, the template references can\n * change at runtime as shown in this example.\n *\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfThenElse'}\n *\n * # Storing conditional result in a variable\n *\n * A common pattern is that we need to show a set of properties from the same object. If the\n * object is undefined, then we have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to guard against\n * dereferencing a `null` value. This is especially the case when waiting on async data such as\n * when using the `async` pipe as shown in folowing example:\n *\n * ```\n * Hello {{ (userStream|async)?.last }}, {{ (userStream|async)?.first }}!\n * ```\n *\n * There are several inefficiencies in the above example:\n *  - We create multiple subscriptions on `userStream`. One for each `async` pipe, or two in the\n *    example above.\n *  - We cannot display an alternative screen while waiting for the data to arrive asynchronously.\n *  - We have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties, which is cumbersome.\n *  - We have to place the `async` pipe in parenthesis.\n *\n * A better way to do this is to use `ngIf` and store the result of the condition in a local\n * variable as shown in the the example below:\n *\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfAs'}\n *\n * Notice that:\n *  - We use only one `async` pipe and hence only one subscription gets created.\n *  - `ngIf` stores the result of the `userStream|async` in the local variable `user`.\n *  - The local `user` can then be bound repeatedly in a more efficient way.\n *  - No need to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties as `ngIf` will only\n *    display the data if `userStream` returns a value.\n *  - We can display an alternative template while waiting for the data.\n *\n * ### Syntax\n *\n * Simple form:\n * - `<div *ngIf=\"condition\">...</div>`\n * - `<div template=\"ngIf condition\">...</div>`\n * - `<ng-template [ngIf]=\"condition\"><div>...</div></ng-template>`\n *\n * Form with an else block:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition; else elseBlock\">...</div>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * Form with a `then` and `else` block:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition; then thenBlock else elseBlock\"></div>\n * <ng-template #thenBlock>...</ng-template>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * Form with storing the value locally:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition as value; else elseBlock\">{{value}}</div>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar NgIf = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _viewContainer\n     * @param {?} templateRef\n     */\n    function NgIf(_viewContainer, templateRef) {\n        this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n        this._context = new NgIfContext();\n        this._thenTemplateRef = null;\n        this._elseTemplateRef = null;\n        this._thenViewRef = null;\n        this._elseViewRef = null;\n        this._thenTemplateRef = templateRef;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(NgIf.prototype, \"ngIf\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} condition\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (condition) {\n            this._context.$implicit = this._context.ngIf = condition;\n            this._updateView();\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgIf.prototype, \"ngIfThen\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} templateRef\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (templateRef) {\n            this._thenTemplateRef = templateRef;\n            this._thenViewRef = null; // clear previous view if any.\n            this._updateView();\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgIf.prototype, \"ngIfElse\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} templateRef\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (templateRef) {\n            this._elseTemplateRef = templateRef;\n            this._elseViewRef = null; // clear previous view if any.\n            this._updateView();\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgIf.prototype._updateView = function () {\n        if (this._context.$implicit) {\n            if (!this._thenViewRef) {\n                this._viewContainer.clear();\n                this._elseViewRef = null;\n                if (this._thenTemplateRef) {\n                    this._thenViewRef =\n                        this._viewContainer.createEmbeddedView(this._thenTemplateRef, this._context);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        else {\n            if (!this._elseViewRef) {\n                this._viewContainer.clear();\n                this._thenViewRef = null;\n                if (this._elseTemplateRef) {\n                    this._elseViewRef =\n                        this._viewContainer.createEmbeddedView(this._elseTemplateRef, this._context);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    };\n    return NgIf;\n}());\nNgIf.decorators = [\n    { type: Directive, args: [{ selector: '[ngIf]' },] },\n];\n/**\n * @nocollapse\n */\nNgIf.ctorParameters = function () { return [\n    { type: ViewContainerRef, },\n    { type: TemplateRef, },\n]; };\nNgIf.propDecorators = {\n    'ngIf': [{ type: Input },],\n    'ngIfThen': [{ type: Input },],\n    'ngIfElse': [{ type: Input },],\n};\n/**\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar NgIfContext = (function () {\n    function NgIfContext() {\n        this.$implicit = null;\n        this.ngIf = null;\n    }\n    return NgIfContext;\n}());\n/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google Inc.
