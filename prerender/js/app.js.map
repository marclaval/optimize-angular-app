The context\n * for each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable\n * set to the current item from the iterable.\n *\n * ### Local Variables\n *\n * `NgForOf` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n *\n * * `index` will be set to the current loop iteration for each template context.\n * * `first` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the first one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `last` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the last one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `even` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an even index.\n * * `odd` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an odd index.\n *\n * ### Change Propagation\n *\n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgForOf` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n *\n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can\n * be animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state\n * such as user input.\n *\n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run.

Typically the:\n *  - `then` template is the inline template of `ngIf` unless bound to a different value.\n *  - `else` template is blank unless it is bound.\n *\n * # Most common usage\n *\n * The most common usage of the `ngIf` directive is to conditionally show the inline template as\n * seen in this example:\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfSimple'}\n *\n * # Showing an alternative template using `else`\n *\n * If it is necessary to display a template when the `expression` is falsy use the `else` template\n * binding as shown. Note that the `else` binding points to a `<ng-template>` labeled `#elseBlock`.\n * The template can be defined anywhere in the component view but is typically placed right after\n * `ngIf` for readability.\n *\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfElse'}\n *\n * # Using non-inlined `then` template\n *\n * Usually the `then` template is the inlined template of the `ngIf`, but it can be changed using\n * a binding (just like `else`). Because `then` and `else` are bindings, the template references can\n * change at runtime as shown in this example.\n *\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfThenElse'}\n *\n * # Storing conditional result in a variable\n *\n * A common pattern is that we need to show a set of properties from the same object. If the\n * object is undefined, then we have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to guard against\n * dereferencing a `null` value. This is especially the case when waiting on async data such as\n * when using the `async` pipe as shown in folowing example:\n *\n * ```\n * Hello {{ (userStream|async)?.last }}, {{ (userStream|async)?.first }}!\n * ```\n *\n * There are several inefficiencies in the above example:\n *  - We create multiple subscriptions on `userStream`. One for each `async` pipe, or two in the\n *    example above.\n *  - We cannot display an alternative screen while waiting for the data to arrive asynchronously.\n *  - We have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties, which is cumbersome.\n *  - We have to place the `async` pipe in parenthesis.\n *\n * A better way to do this is to use `ngIf` and store the result of the condition in a local\n * variable as shown in the the example below:\n *\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfLet'}\n *\n * Notice that:\n *  - We use only one `async` pipe and hence only one subscription gets created.\n *  - `ngIf` stores the result of the `userStream|async` in the local variable `user`.\n *  - The local `user` can then be bound repeatedly in a more efficient way.\n *  - No need to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties as `ngIf` will only\n *    display the data if `userStream` returns a value.\n *  - We can display an alternative template while waiting for the data.\n *\n * ### Syntax\n *\n * Simple form:\n * - `<div *ngIf=\"condition\">...</div>`\n * - `<div template=\"ngIf condition\">...</div>`\n * - `<ng-template [ngIf]=\"condition\"><div>...</div></ng-template>`\n *\n * Form with an else block:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition; else elseBlock\">...</div>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * Form with a `then` and `else` block:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition; then thenBlock else elseBlock\"></div>\n * <ng-template #thenBlock>...</ng-template>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * Form with storing the value locally:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition; else elseBlock; let

*\n * When linking to this `user/:name` route, you can write:\n * `<a routerLink='/user/bob'>link to user component</a>`\n *\n * \\@description\n *\n * The RouterLink directives let you link to specific parts of your app.\n *\n * When the link is static, you can use the directive as follows:\n * `<a routerLink=\"/user/bob\">link to user component</a>`\n *\n * If you use dynamic values to generate the link, you can pass an array of path\n * segments, followed by the params for each segment.\n *\n * For instance `['/team', teamId, 'user', userName, {details: true}]`\n * means that we want to generate a link to `/team/11/user/bob;details=true`.\n *\n * Multiple static segments can be merged into one\n * (e.g., `['/team/11/user', userName, {details: true}]`).\n *\n * The first segment name can be prepended with `/`, `./`, or `../`:\n * * If the first segment begins with `/`, the router will look up the route from the root of the\n *   app.\n * * If the first segment begins with `./`, or doesn't begin with a slash, the router will\n *   instead look in the children of the current activated route.\n * * And if the first segment begins with `../`, the router will go up one level.\n *\n * You can set query params and fragment as follows:\n *\n * ```\n * <a [routerLink]=\"['/user/bob']\" [queryParams]=\"{debug: true}\" fragment=\"education\">\n *   link to user component\n * </a>\n * ```\n * RouterLink will use these to generate this link: `/user/bob#education?debug=true`.\n *\n * (Deprecated in v4.0.0 use `queryParamsHandling` instead) You can also tell the\n * directive to preserve the current query params and fragment:\n *\n * ```\n * <a [routerLink]=\"['/user/bob']\" preserveQueryParams preserveFragment>\n *   link to user component\n * </a>\n * ```\n *\n * You can tell the directive to how to handle queryParams, available options are:\n *  - 'merge' merge the queryParams into the current queryParams\n *  - 'preserve' prserve the current queryParams\n *  - default / '' use the queryParams only\n *  same options for {\\@link NavigationExtras.queryParamsHandling}\n *\n * ```\n * <a [routerLink]=\"['/user/bob']\" [queryParams]=\"{debug: true}\" queryParamsHandling=\"merge\">\n *   link to user component\n * </a>\n * ```\n *\n * The router link directive always treats the provided input as a delta to the current url.\n *\n * For instance, if the current url is `/user/(box//aux:team)`.\n *\n * Then the following link `<a [routerLink]=\"['/user/jim']\">Jim</a>` will generate the link\n * `/user/(jim//aux:team)`.\n *\n *

\\@howToUse\n *\n * ```\n * <a routerLink=\"/user/bob\" routerLinkActive=\"active-link\">Bob</a>\n * ```\n *\n * \\@description\n *\n * The RouterLinkActive directive lets you add a CSS class to an element when the link's route\n * becomes active.\n *\n * Consider the following example:\n *\n * ```\n * <a routerLink=\"/user/bob\" routerLinkActive=\"active-link\">Bob</a>\n * ```\n *\n * When the url is either '/user' or '/user/bob', the active-link class will\n * be added to the `a` tag. If the url changes, the class will be removed.\n *\n * You can set more than one class, as follows:\n *\n * ```\n * <a routerLink=\"/user/bob\" routerLinkActive=\"class1 class2\">Bob</a>\n * <a routerLink=\"/user/bob\" [routerLinkActive]=\"['class1', 'class2']\">Bob</a>\n * ```\n *\n * You can configure RouterLinkActive by passing `exact: true`. This will add the classes\n * only when the url matches the link exactly.\n *\n * ```\n * <a routerLink=\"/user/bob\" routerLinkActive=\"active-link\" [routerLinkActiveOptions]=\"{exact:\n * true}\">Bob</a>\n * ```\n *\n * You can assign the RouterLinkActive instance to a template variable and directly check\n * the `isActive` status.\n * ```\n * <a routerLink=\"/user/bob\" routerLinkActive #rla=\"routerLinkActive\">\n *   Bob {{ rla.isActive ? '(already open)' : ''}}\n * </a>\n * ```\n *\n * Finally, you can apply the RouterLinkActive directive to an ancestor of a RouterLink.\n *\n * ```\n * <div routerLinkActive=\"active-link\" [routerLinkActiveOptions]=\"{exact: true}\">\n *   <a routerLink=\"/user/jim\">Jim</a>\n *   <a routerLink=\"/user/bob\">Bob</a>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * This will set the active-link class on the div tag if the url is either '/user/jim' or\n * '/user/bob'.\n *\n * \\@ngModule RouterModule\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\n\nvar RouterLinkActive = function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} router\n     * @param {?} element\n     * @param {?} renderer\n     * @param {?} cdr\n     */\n    function RouterLinkActive(router, element, renderer, cdr) {\n        var _this35 = this;\n\n        _classCallCheck(this, RouterLinkActive);\n\n        this.router = router;\n        this.element = element;\n        this.renderer = renderer;\n        this.cdr = cdr;\n        this.classes = [];\n        this.active = false;\n        this.routerLinkActiveOptions = { exact: false };\n        this.subscription = router.events.subscribe(function (s) {\n            if (s instanceof NavigationEnd) {\n                _this35.update();\n            }\n        });\n    }\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n\n\n    _createClass(RouterLinkActive, [{\n        key: 'ngAfterContentInit',\n\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        value: function ngAfterContentInit() {\n            var _this36 = this;\n\n            this.links.changes.subscribe(function (_) {\n                return _this36.update();\n            });\n            this.linksWithHrefs.changes.subscribe(function (_) {\n                return _this36.update();\n            });\n            this.update();\n        }\n        /**\n         * @param {?} data\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n\n    }, {\n        key: 'ngOnChanges',\n\n        /**\n         * @param {?} changes\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        value: function ngOnChanges(changes) {\n            this.update();\n        }\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n\n    }, {\n        key: 'ngOnDestroy',\n        value: function ngOnDestroy() {\n            this.subscription.unsubscribe();\n        }\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n\n    }, {\n        key: 'update',\n        value: function update() {\n            var _this37 = this;\n\n            if (!this.links || !this.linksWithHrefs || !this.router.navigated) return;\n            var /** @type {?} */hasActiveLinks = this.hasActiveLinks();\n            // react only when status has changed to prevent unnecessary dom updates\n            if (this.active !== hasActiveLinks) {\n                this.active = hasActiveLinks;\n                this.classes.forEach(function (c) {\n                    return _this37.renderer.setElementClass(_this37.element.nativeElement, c, hasActiveLinks);\n                });\n                this.cdr.detectChanges();\n            }\n        }\n        /**\n         * @param {?} router\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n\n    }, {\n        key: 'isLinkActive',\n        value: function isLinkActive(router) {\n            var _this38 = this;\n\n            return function (link) {\n                return router.isActive(link.urlTree, _this38.routerLinkActiveOptions.exact);\n            };\n        }\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n\n    }, {\n        key: 'hasActiveLinks',\n        value: function hasActiveLinks() {\n            return this.links.some(this.isLinkActive(this.router)) || this.linksWithHrefs.some(this.isLinkActive(this.router));\n        }\n    }, {\n        key: 'isActive',\n        get: function get() {\n            return this.active;\n        }\n    }, {\n        key: 'routerLinkActive',\n        set: function set(data) {\n            var /** @type {?} */classes = Array.isArray(data) ?

The context\n * for each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable\n * set to the current item from the iterable.\n *\n * ### Local Variables\n *\n * `NgForOf` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n *\n * * `index` will be set to the current loop iteration for each template context.\n * * `first` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the first one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `last` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the last one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `even` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an even index.\n * * `odd` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an odd index.\n *\n * ### Change Propagation\n *\n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgForOf` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n *\n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can\n * be animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state\n * such as user input.\n *\n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run.

Typically the:\n *  - `then` template is the inline template of `ngIf` unless bound to a different value.\n *  - `else` template is blank unless it is bound.\n *\n * # Most common usage\n *\n * The most common usage of the `ngIf` directive is to conditionally show the inline template as\n * seen in this example:\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfSimple'}\n *\n * # Showing an alternative template using `else`\n *\n * If it is necessary to display a template when the `expression` is falsy use the `else` template\n * binding as shown. Note that the `else` binding points to a `<ng-template>` labeled `#elseBlock`.\n * The template can be defined anywhere in the component view but is typically placed right after\n * `ngIf` for readability.\n *\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfElse'}\n *\n * # Using non-inlined `then` template\n *\n * Usually the `then` template is the inlined template of the `ngIf`, but it can be changed using\n * a binding (just like `else`). Because `then` and `else` are bindings, the template references can\n * change at runtime as shown in this example.\n *\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfThenElse'}\n *\n * # Storing conditional result in a variable\n *\n * A common pattern is that we need to show a set of properties from the same object. If the\n * object is undefined, then we have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to guard against\n * dereferencing a `null` value. This is especially the case when waiting on async data such as\n * when using the `async` pipe as shown in folowing example:\n *\n * ```\n * Hello {{ (userStream|async)?.last }}, {{ (userStream|async)?.first }}!\n * ```\n *\n * There are several inefficiencies in the above example:\n *  - We create multiple subscriptions on `userStream`. One for each `async` pipe, or two in the\n *    example above.\n *  - We cannot display an alternative screen while waiting for the data to arrive asynchronously.\n *  - We have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties, which is cumbersome.\n *  - We have to place the `async` pipe in parenthesis.\n *\n * A better way to do this is to use `ngIf` and store the result of the condition in a local\n * variable as shown in the the example below:\n *\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfLet'}\n *\n * Notice that:\n *  - We use only one `async` pipe and hence only one subscription gets created.\n *  - `ngIf` stores the result of the `userStream|async` in the local variable `user`.\n *  - The local `user` can then be bound repeatedly in a more efficient way.\n *  - No need to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties as `ngIf` will only\n *    display the data if `userStream` returns a value.\n *  - We can display an alternative template while waiting for the data.\n *\n * ### Syntax\n *\n * Simple form:\n * - `<div *ngIf=\"condition\">...</div>`\n * - `<div template=\"ngIf condition\">...</div>`\n * - `<ng-template [ngIf]=\"condition\"><div>...</div></ng-template>`\n *\n * Form with an else block:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition; else elseBlock\">...</div>\n * <ng-template

specific parts of your app.\n *\n * \\@howToUse\n *\n * Consider the following route configuration:\n * `[{ path: 'user/:name', component: UserCmp }]`\n *\n * When linking to this `user/:name` route, you can write:\n * `<a routerLink='/user/bob'>link to user component</a>`\n *\n * \\@description\n *\n * The RouterLink directives let you link to specific parts of your app.\n *\n * When the link is static, you can use the directive as follows:\n * `<a routerLink=\"/user/bob\">link to user component</a>`\n *\n * If you use dynamic values to generate the link, you can pass an array of path\n * segments, followed by the params for each segment.\n *\n * For instance `['/team', teamId, 'user', userName, {details: true}]`\n * means that we want to generate a link to `/team/11/user/bob;details=true`.\n *\n * Multiple static segments can be merged into one\n * (e.g., `['/team/11/user', userName, {details: true}]`).\n *\n * The first segment name can be prepended with `/`, `./`, or `../`:\n * * If the first segment begins with `/`, the router will look up the route from the root of the\n *   app.\n * * If the first segment begins with `./`, or doesn't begin with a slash, the router will\n *   instead look in the children of the current activated route.\n * * And if the first segment begins with `../`, the router will go up one level.\n *\n * You can set query params and fragment as follows:\n *\n * ```\n * <a [routerLink]=\"['/user/bob']\" [queryParams]=\"{debug: true}\" fragment=\"education\">\n *   link to user component\n * </a>\n * ```\n * RouterLink will use these to generate this link: `/user/bob#education?debug=true`.\n *\n * (Deprecated in v4.0.0 use `queryParamsHandling` instead) You can also tell the\n * directive to preserve the current query params and fragment:\n *\n * ```\n * <a [routerLink]=\"['/user/bob']\" preserveQueryParams preserveFragment>\n *   link to user component\n * </a>\n * ```\n *\n * You can tell the directive to how to handle queryParams, available options are:\n *  - 'merge' merge the queryParams into the current queryParams\n *  - 'preserve' prserve the current queryParams\n *  - default / '' use the queryParams only\n *  same options for {\\@link NavigationExtras.queryParamsHandling}\n *\n * ```\n * <a [routerLink]=\"['/user/bob']\" [queryParams]=\"{debug: true}\" queryParamsHandling=\"merge\">\n *   link to user component\n * </a>\n * ```\n *\n * The router link directive always treats the provided input as a delta to the current url.\n *\n * For instance, if the current url is `/user/(box//aux:team)`.\n *\n * Then the following link `<a [routerLink]=\"['/user/jim']\">Jim</a>` will generate the link\n * `/user/(jim//aux:team)`.\n *\n * \\@ngModule

class will\n * be added to the `a` tag.
